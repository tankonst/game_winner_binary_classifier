# Predicting the winner
 Kaggle in-class competition
 
The game has two teams: Radiant and Dire. In these notebooks, we predict the winner. This is a classification task which returns 1 for the prediction that Radiant wins and 0 for the prediction that Dire wins. We aim to maximize the metric: ROC AUC for the Kaggle competition.
